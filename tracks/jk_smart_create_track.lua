--		# Situations
--		- If no tracks is selected
--			- Create a track at the end of the track count
--		- If one track is selected
--			- If it is a "base level track" (i.e. not parented) = create another base level track
--			- If it is the end of a folder = create a base level track/normal track within the overarching folder structure (if there is one)
--			- If it is within a folder structure = create another track within that structure
--		- If multiple tracks selected
--			- If the last track selected is the end of the folder structure:
--				- If the first track selected is within the same folder structure/the parent of it = create a track and make it the new end of that structure
--				- If the first track is a "grandparent"/part of an overarching folder structure = create a track and make it the end of that folder if there isn't one already otherwise add it as a base level track
--			-If it is not the end of the folder structure = create a track within that folder
